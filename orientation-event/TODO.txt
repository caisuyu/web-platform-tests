Testable assertions extracted from the specification,
http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source-orientation.html

* 4.1 deviceorientation Event
  - Registration for, and firing of the deviceorientation event must follow the usual behavior of DOM4 Events, [DOM4].

* 4.2 compassneedscalibration Event
  - User agents implementing this specification must provide a new DOM event, named compassneedscalibration
  - This event must fire on the window object.
  - Registration for, and firing of the compassneedscalibration event must follow the usual behavior of DOM4 Events [DOM4].
  - User agents must also provide an event handler IDL attribute [HTML5] named oncompassneedscalibration on the window object.
  - The type of the corresponding event must be compassneedcalibration.
  - This event must be fired when the user agent determines that a compass used to obtain orientation data is in need of calibration.
  - The default action of this event should be for the user agent to present the user with details of how to calibrate the compass.
  - The event must be cancelable, so that web sites can provide their own alternative calibration UI.

* 4.3 devicemotion Event
  - Registration for, and firing of the devicemotion event must follow the usual behavior of DOM4 Events, [DOM4].
  - The rotationRate attribute must be initialized with the rate of rotation of the hosting device in space.
    It must be expressed as the rate of change of the angles of the defined in section 4.1 and must be expressed in deg/s.
  - The interval attribute must be initialized with the interval at which data is obtained from the underlying hardware
    and must be expressed in milliseconds.
    It must be a constant, to simplify filtering of the data by the Web application.
  - Implementations that are unable to provide all attributes must initialize the values of the unknown attributes to null.
    If an implementation can never provide motion information, the event should be fired with all attributes set to null.
