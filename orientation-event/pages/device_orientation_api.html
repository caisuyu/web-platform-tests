<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This page links to a series of test cases for the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source-orientation.html">W3C DeviceOrientation Event Specification</a>. It is organised by section, and (more or less) categorizes each test according to which statement in the specification it relates to.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>The tests are designed to be run manually.</p>

    <q>User agents implementing this specification must provide a new DOM event, named deviceorientation.</q>

  </li>

  <li>
    <q>The corresponding event must be of type DeviceOrientationEvent and must fire on the window object.</q>

  <li>
    <q>Registration for, and firing of the deviceorientation event must follow the usual behavior of DOM Level 2 Events, [DOMEVENTS].</q>
    <br><small>No tests.</small>
  </li>

  <li>
    <q>User agents must also provide an event handler IDL attribute [HTML5] named ondeviceorientation on the window object. The type of this event handler must be DeviceOrientationEvent.</q>

    <br><small><a href="../DeviceOrientation/t009.html">Test 009</a>: checks if beta is between -180 and 180 and not defined at zero.</small>

	<li>
		<q>Implementations that are unable to provide all three angles must set the values of the unknown angles to null. If any angles are provided, the absolute property must be set appropriately. If an implementation can never provide orientation information, the event should be fired with all properties set to null.</q>
